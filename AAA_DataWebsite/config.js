  '<p>Online shopping has never been easier. With a few taps, packages arrive at our doorsteps—fast, cheap, frictionless. To keep up with this growing demand, New York City began reevaluating its delivery systems in the mid-2010s.</p>'+ 
  '<p>In 2019, the city released its Smart Truck Management Plan, proposing new ways to handle freight more efficiently. In 2021, it piloted micro-distribution hubs—small-scale transfer points for cargo bikes and electric vans—to reduce truck congestion in residential areas. Meanwhile, warehouses and fulfillment centers rapidly multiplied, often tucked into neighborhoods they once avoided.</p>' +
  '<p>But in chasing speed and convenience, one question remains: Where do these packages actually come from—and how do they get here?</p>'+

  "<p>Since 2008, e-commerce has grown more than fourfold in the U.S., rising from <strong>3.6%</strong> to <strong>16%</strong> of total retail sales by 2023. In New York City, this surge has transformed the logistics landscape, putting enormous pressure on urban freight systems.</p>" +
  "<p>Nationwide, <strong>over 90% of goods are transported by trucks</strong> at some point in their journey, and NYC is no exception. The city’s e-commerce boom has led to a dramatic increase in truck activity—<strong>freight transportation employment grew 29%</strong>, and <strong>warehousing and storage employment rose 382%</strong> over the past decade.</p>" +
  "<p>Despite this growth, the physical infrastructure has largely remained unchanged. Trucks continue to rely on a fixed network of designated truck routes to deliver goods across boroughs.</p>";

  "<p>Before 2020, New York City's logistics landscape was shaped by aging warehouses built for a different era. These facilities were not equipped for the demands of fast, high-volume, last-mile delivery — laying the foundation for today’s growing logistics challenges.</p>" +

  "<p>The COVID-19 pandemic marked a turning point in the evolution of urban logistics.</p>" +
  "<p>In 2020, as lockdowns swept across the United States, consumers rapidly shifted to online shopping — pushing e-commerce sales up by 43% in a single year, from $571 billion in 2019 to $815 billion in 2020, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.</p>" +
  "<p>To meet surging demand for fast, last-mile delivery, logistics companies rushed to build warehouses in all five boroughs — particularly in outer areas like Queens, Brooklyn, and the Bronx. This rapid infrastructure expansion helped keep the city’s supply chains moving, but it also introduced new spatial and environmental pressures that are still unfolding today.</p>";

  "<p style='max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>After a few weeks of the declaration of state of emergency, subway usage in the city reached its lowest point, almost 90% less than the same time period the year before. Since then, the number of people that use the subway has remained drastically low. Even after the city began its re-opening scheme on June 8, 2020, subway usage was still more than 70% below 2019 levels.</p>" +

  "<p style='max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>This difference, however, varies across the city, with some parts of it seeing a much steeper decline and others witnessing a stronger recovery. Nevertheless, even a year after the pandemic first hit New York City, the number of daily subway commuters remains below 2019 levels.</p>" +
  "<p style='max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>That being said, other transportation networks have fared differently. For example, after a similar decline right after the state of emergency was declared, Citibike has seen its number of users reach and even surpass 2019 levels. City buses, on the other hand, also remain underutilized compared to their usage pre-pandemic.</p>";

The area's three main neighborhoods, Mott Haven, Melrose and Port Morris are mostly home to low-income families that have been forced to continue going to work, risking their health and that of their loved ones. Similarly to Jackson Heights in Queens, the areas subway stations have seen a smaller decrease in use than the rest of the city. Median household income in this area oscillates between $15,000 and $30,000.</p>";

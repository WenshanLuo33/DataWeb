These areas, including the rest of queens have many narrow streets, which make it difficult to make sharp and drive-through. Congested St., Steinway Street for example deals with more pollution high traffic and large trucks routed in this direction. Create a lot of delays. This has increased pedestrian safety, and min areas. I think that there should be more streets where trucks are restricted from driving down. The two-way streets are actually just one-way streets and in order for one small car to go down the road. They have to wait for the opposing direction so they can drive. When it comes to trucks, there is no stopping and waiting for card they have to take access of the road. More congestion has also increased asthma throughout different parts of cleans as well. I think that should include the BLVDs and the highways. There are multiple options to remedy these issues of traffic safety, however, when it Comes to rerouting specifically I feel that restricting more streets and avenues for trucks to go down as well as increasing enforcement of legislation is also important.",

Further, when my daughter and I are walking home from school in the late afternoon I have observed many ambulances stuck behind trucks on Caton when cars are able to move to allow ambulances to pass; most of the ambulances seem to be heading to/from Maimomades and Kings County/University Hospital Brooklyn and the dense housing in the area.

Oversize 18-wheeler trucks and construction vehicles go up and down this road all hours of the day and night, speeding, honking and spewing black smoke and grime into the air.  This is a road with one lane of traffic on each direction and it is too narrow for trucks to be on the same road as city buses (B16), a subway stop (Church Avenue), two schools, the soccer and baseball fields at Parade Grounds, playgrounds and residential buildings.  18 wheelers don't belong on two-lane residential streets.  It is unsafe and it causes non stop traffic back ups because there is not enough room for trucks, buses and people all in one place.",

It leads to higher rates of high blood pressure, hypertension, even stroke - all of which disproportionately impact Black Americans. This route runs through the heart of Flatbush and is yet another example of environmental racism causing real harm. 2) Air quality: According to a 2022 study by the International Council for Clean Transportation, “In New York City, heavy-duty diesel vehicles represent a small portion of total vehicle activity but are responsible for roughly half of on-road transport nitrogen oxides (NO,) and fine particulate matter (PM.5) emissions and the associated health impacts, including premature mortality. This analysis finds that people of color living in New York City are exposed to 5% more PM.5 attributable to diesel trucks operating in the city than average, while non-Latino white residents are exposed to 10% less.” Again, this kind of injustice is unacceptable. 3) And let’s talk for a second about quality of life: we can’t open our windows without constant interruptions. And it’s upwards of 98 degrees outside these days. What are we expected to do? And on a more personal note, forget the amount of times I’ve been startled awake by these trucks (from honking and booming through potholes and uneven pavement) - and keep in mind I sleep with ear plugs and closed windows - my newborn is also startled awake on the regular. This needs to be addressed ASAP and the solution must be transparent, inclusive and community driven. ",

Truck traffic has created many dangerously close encounters between children and trucks on the Grand Concourse. I am also deeply concerned about the truck pollution being so close to the many children who play in this area. It would be greatly beneficial is truck traffic were re-routed through another thoroughfare without as many parks, playgrounds and children in the immediate area.",

In particular, trucks coming along 147th Ave are turning onto 227th Street in order to access a warehouse located one block away. 227th Street is narrow, and the road is certainly not built to accommodate the weight of these trucks, many of which are the 53-foot, 18-wheeler trucks. When making the turn on this corner, these trucks often experience great difficulty. Parked cars have been sideswiped and overhead utility lines are often dislodged. On numerous occasions, residents have had to come out of their homes to assist drivers to negotiate the turn and to alert neighbors to move cars. Sometimes this takes place in the middle of the night. Our streets have been destroyed and our homes shake under the weight of the trucks. Many of us do not open our windows because the unhealthy dust that the trucks generate gets into our homes. These larger trucks, in particular, should not be allowed on our local streets. Their activity should be monitored, and penalties should be issued accordingly. DOT should be working aggressively with City and State police to ensure that this happens.",

It extends from145th Ave to 148th Ave along Hook Creek Blvd. I have seen numerous 53-foot trucks within the confines of the worksite. My concern is that these trucks have been traveling illegally along our residential streets. 53-foot trucks are not allowed on NYC streets without benefit of a permit (https://www.dot.ny.gov/about-nysdot/faq/are-53-foot-long-trailers-allowed-in-nyc) and there is no indication that the truck traffic along this area is being monitored. While DOT may suggest that monitoring of truck traffic is not its job, the fact of the matter is that without DOT accountability and in the absence of conscientious, consistent collaboration of DOT with the appropriate policing agents (city and/or state), efforts to re-design the truck route will not result in an equitable solution for burdened communities, such as those in Southeast Queens.",

Pedestrians have to try to cross the road at the entrance to a highway at the same time as vehicle traffic from opposing directions is converging to turn onto the same highway. Drivers are distracted by the oncoming traffic making the turn onto the same roadway as them, and visibility is limited all around by trucks and buses, including buses pulling out of the bus stops on the Westbound lanes of Church Avenue. The lights are not long enough for pedestrians to safely we get across the roadway, even without having to navigate and dodge around traffic. And drivers are frustrated by the lack of visibility and the amount of time it takes 18 wheeler trucks, buses, and other vehicles to make the turn and then make poor decisions trying to get around it to get through the intersection.

The traffic nightmare each and every weekday is due to the unnecessary pedestrian and bike lane that takes away the East Bound 20th Street lane and making it one way West bound. Few people use this pedestrian through-fair as opposed to the thousands of motorist and trucks that are dramatically increased their commute by an hour each day...Add an hour more... The 20th Street pattern change also creates a  danger for emergency response vehicles as per there are at lease 3 local hospitals that are affected. The exit off the Prospect is included in this traffic pattern effects Truck route #27 which is a route used to transport from the Brooklyn docks to JFK  Airport...

Even more on the stretch between Bushwick and Lorimer, which includes PS 132!  There is no justification for allowing trucks to continue to use metropolitan.  It is unsafe, period.",

And again the construction causes all this traffic when trucks who have to deliver need to double park because of the lack of respect ! All hours of the day and night large trucks, busses, cement trucks, garbage trucks, loaded trucks every truck you can imagine is going down this avenue. All of them jay break which is such a beautiful sound to hear at 2am. They honk their horns all through the day. When they stop the vehicle for a red light they screetch and bang their breaks. Living on metropolitan avenue is awful for the amount of money one has to pay for rent, can’t even get decent fkn sleep at night or any peace of mind during the damn day !!!!!! ",

Trucks speed down Metropolitan to reach the BQE.  Why not route them through the industrial area to reach the BQE?  It would be no longer of a route for the trucks than going down Metropolitan.  Overall it would vastly improve the residential, pedestrian and retail experience on Metropolitan.  This would increase property values and taxes, a boon for the city.",

North bound Hicks St south of Atlantic Ave. is not wide enough for the volume of trucks and cars—most are turning left from Hicks St onto Atlantic Ave and then getting onto the BQE from the nearby on-ramp. This traffic frequently blocks the intersection, preventing traffic from flowing smoothly traveling westbound on Atlantic or northbound on Hicks. It also makes it unsafe for pedestrians as trucks and cars frequently run the light or block crosswalks. This has gotten much worse since the hospital building opened on the southeast corner of the intersection. Please consider widening Hicks St south of Atlantic to provide an additional left turn lane; the area is currently blocked off by construction hoardings and not in use. Another idea would be a dedicated left turn arrow, and/or much larger and clearer signage further south on Hicks St, so trucks and cars can get into the correct lane much farther south. Traffic patterns at this intersection should be considered in conjunction with patterns at the BQE on-ramp just to the west, as trucks and cars traveling eastbound on Atlantic then turning left onto this on-ramp also frequently block the intersection, again blocking flow of traffic on Atlantic in both directions and causing dangers for pedestrians. There are many pedestrians in this area as it is the main route into Brooklyn Bridge Park and the Pier 6 ferry terminal. ",

The boxes should be sorted when the trucks pick them up from pick them up and load on the trucks from the depot.  They should follow the same procedure as ups. Currently boxes are thrown in the streets and sidewalks blocking the sidewalks and streets for an extended period of time. I called Amazon to see if they would help (mostly amazon boxes) however fell on deaf ears. The boxes are in the street and in the sidewalks for several hours before the deliveries are completed. ",

Caton Avenue is exclusively residential between McDonald Ave. and Ocean Parkway with, as others have noted, several schools and a public library nearby.  Traffic is incessant and loud, and the confusion at the major point where Ft. Hamilton Pky, Caton Ave., and McDonald Avenue intersect historically has been dangerous, with trucks, cars, bicycles, and buses from several routes converging and attempting merges and turns.  Ft. Hamilton Pky runs one way from E.5th to McDonald; Caton probably should be a one-way street as well.  There is a dedicated bicycle lane on Ft. Hamilton; Caton does not need one.  Above all, enforcement is key, to stop: (1) speeding, (2) vehicles running red lights, (3) vehicles operating in the bicycle lane(s), (4) illegal turns, (5) scooters and other motorized two-wheel vehicles operating illegally, including in the bicycle lane(s) (and on sidewalks), (6) gridlock, particularly at intersections with signals, among other things.  This is a badly planned and managed stretch of roadway, and a poor choice for a truck route, especially given the way the Caton narrows to the east of Coney Island Avenue (also confusing, filled with children, and constantly choked with pedestrian, truck, bicycle, and bus traffic).",

They disrupt people's sleep and contribute to asthma and other breathing problems. A few days with the windows open and the ledge is covered in black soot. The noise, particularly at night and the early hours of the morning is intense. You hear every wheel hitting every pothole. The trucks shake the building and use their horns. When they block the sidewalk, pedestrians can't see, and the traffic they cause makes other drivers impatient so that they speed, run through red lights and also go heavy on their horns. This beautiful neighborhood is being absolutely destroyed by these large trucks. I have had many neighbors move because they simply could not take it anymore.   ",

I've nearly been hit because of this three times this year. On 07/09/24 a large motorcoach bus was making this right turn as I was crossing the street -- as I got halfway across and cleared the bus the semi-truck that was stopped at a red light proceeded to make a right turn slowly driving into my path.  Probably to make room for the bus -- but not seeing me as I was near its grill.  I got across the road.  But this is a dangerous cross -- especially with tall vehicles that have major blind spots when it comes to pedestrians.",

They are also idling for long periods of time while doubled parked on 147th Ave between 184st and 181st waiting for a bay to pull in their truck. Small Package Express located on 147-20 184th and 147-15 on 183st is a big problem with this idling and horn blowing in a residential community across for it. Why aren't there any warning signs of fines for idling or horn blowing? I'd complained about this in the past and it was approved by DOT# DOT-531712-T1Y8 - Truck Signs. But I seen none to very, very little improvements since. They claimed they put one sign up at a location that I was not concern about. This is an viromental concern that we have been fighting and putting up with for years.\r\n\r\nThank you\r\nKeith Wingfield \r\nCommunity Advocate ",

Trucks use it as a shortcut between the LIE and the entrance to the BQE, the addition of speed bumps and numerous requests from residents to the DOT has not resulted in any change. There is an elementary school at the end of the street, which is dangerous on its own (there was also recently a fatal accident on the corner of Driggs and Monitor) but the trucks that illegally drive up Monitor Street also rip down branches from the old trees that arch over the street, and tear up the streets that were not meant to support that much weight or vehicles of that height. The houses on the street are over 100 years old with wood foundations, and the vibration of the constant truck traffic is slowly destroying the integrity of these buildings, which mostly house working and middle class residents. There have been many suggestions for solutions to this problem by residents over the years, but the problem persists. ",

This presents a very dangerous situation for pedestrians. There are several schools in close proximity.\r\n\r\nDrivers of smaller vehicles also speed through the yellow light since traffic backs up. They end up blocking the crosswalks for pedestrians, as well as or cars driving up E 3rd street. At times I've had to sit through a couple of light cycles before I can make it through that intersection.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there is a lot of trash and pollution along Caton avenue from all the through traffic. \r\n\r\nThis is a residential area with narrow streets, schools, playgrounds and parks that sees a lot of foot traffic, so inappropriate for such large vehicles and high volume traffic.

It's particularly concerning since lots of kids take these lanes to get to the nearby schools. Too many truck drivers do not exhibit any caution, and either don't see them from their giant cabs, or don't care. This truck route is a tragedy waiting to happen. ",

They are  often reckless, barreling through intersections well over the speed limit and blocking the intersections all along Caton Ave. resulting in dangerous crossings. There is nowhere for them to park (it is a small road, one lane in each direction) and they block the regular flow of traffic; they are also incredibly loud, often waking up residents early in the morning or late at night. The street actually shakes when some of those giant trucks go by -- it is not built for them. In the long run, air pollution is also an issue. I can see the exhaust and grime accumulate on my seven-year-old's windowsills just a few days after they are cleaned. I sincerely hope these trucks can be routed another way. Thank you. ",

It is a turnoff from the West Side Highway, Google Building, Chelsea Market, Dream Hotel, Maritime Hotel, Western Beef.  Our block is a narrow residential block with legal parking on the North + South side of the street.  There are signs posted on 7th Avenue & 16th street that say no trucks allowed down the block but in the 20+ years I've lived here that has been ignored.  These trucks can easily use 14th Street to crosstown.  It has caused major problems.  With all the commercial businesses I mentioned there are private sanitation trucks that come barreling down the street all hours of the night. Not pleasant especially when they drive fast and go over the 2 speed bumps on our block.  Very noisy.   Often times cars are double parked which means the trucks can't get through due to how narrow the street is causing honking that's non-stop.  Trucks should not be allowed down the street.  We get enough traffic with just cars as Chelsea, Meatpacking, Highline area have become very popular with lots of foot traffic and  tourists.  Its dangerous and we have actually had one death with a truck. ",

Businesses located on west 23rd street are often supplied goods through service entrances on west 22nd street between 8th and 6th avenue including The Hotel Chelsea, The westside market, The Burlington coat factory.  Many deliveries heading East from 10th or 8th avenue avoid 23rd street congestion and speed East through west 22nd street.

During rush hour, emergency vehicles often can't get through, and the amount of gridlock, honking and exhaust makes it unbearable to be within a few blocks of from 3pm-6pm on most weekdays.  The presence of large haul tractor trailers, which don't belong on this tight circle, greatly exacerbate it.  Plus, the entrance to the Circle from NB Prospect Expressway traffic immediately after Church Avenue overload the Circle with traffic, leading to the biggest source of honking and exhaust, and where they enter at the traffic light is the apex of where trucks get stuck. There is already a speed camera on CIA, it should be used to also issue citations to trucks taking the unlawful shortcut.",

Currently, big trucks illegally using Ocean Parkway (trucks are forbidden on Parkways in New York City) lean on their horn when seeing these drivers.  It's a very dangerous intersection leading to a playground, a school, a church and a library, as well as steady foot traffic to the park which end up walking on the bike lane becauese it feels safer than crossing at that intersection.",

        "comment_body": "This area is plagued by truck activity, which includes truck traffic and parking. Trucks are traveling between the busy Rockaway Blvd and 147th Ave (making the turn onto 147th Avenue via Guy Brewer Blvd. This area is not part of the JFK BID. The residents who live in this area are subjected to constant truck traffic and congestion, especially during rush hour. This is compounded by the presence of a truck repair business on the South side of 147th Avenue and 178th Street.  \r\nThis area is also a part of the city bus route. The diesel fumes and traffic generated by all of this activity makes for an especially hazardous living situation for the people in the area, including the single- and two-family homes, the two shelters located on the corner of Guy Brewer and 147th Avenue and the public school located just past 147th Avenue (along Guy Brewer Blvd). The property values of the homes in the area are sure to be depressed by this activity. I am particularly concerned about the fact that, in addition to all of these burdens, clearance has been given to developers to construct a mixed-use building on the corner of Guy Brewer and 147th Avenue. This construction will increase traffic, pollution and risk to more residents and pedestrians.\r\nIn closing, I will point out that much of this activity includes the movement and parking of 53-foot/18-wheeler trucks which, with few exceptions, are not allowed on NYC City Streets, per Section 385 of the NYS Vehicle & Traffic Law, (https://www.dot.ny.gov/about-nysdot/faq/are-53-foot-long-trailers-allowed-in-nyc). Such large trucks should NEVER be allowed on local NYC streets, as our roads are not built to accommodate them and they pose safety and health hazards to residents and pedestrians.\r\n",

        "comment_body": "This very active Springfield Gardens warehouse is not within the JFK BID district, and it is not a part of the current trucking route (nor should it be in the future). Yet an active trucking warehouse is embedded here, sandwiched in between several Brookville residential communities. As a result, trucks of all sizes (most notably, 18-wheelers) traverse our narrow residential streets, shaking our homes, spewing toxic tailpipe emissions and sending dust particles into our lungs. They sideswipe our parked cars, pull down our overhead utility lines and damage our roads, adding to our disruption, and posing serious health threats and safety hazards, especially to the children at play. This is clearly not suitable activity for an environmental justice community already plagued by airplane noise and air pollution.\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest problems is the movement of 53-foot/18-wheeler trucks through our local streets. Per section 385 of the Vehicle & Traffic Law (https://www.dot.ny.gov/about-nysdot/faq/are-53-foot-long-trailers-allowed-in-nyc), unless they have special permits, 53-foot trucks are allowed only on routes through NYC to reach destinations in Long Island, using specified connections along I-95, I-295 and I-495; and they are allowed to access JFK Airport via the Van Wyck Expressway. However, they are not allowed to make pickups or deliveries in any of the boroughs of New York City. This means that many of the trucks we see may in fact be illegally traveling on our local streets. But there is no way of knowing or tracking this activity, as there appears to be very little effective coordination of monitoring activity with the NYPD. \r\n\r\nLocal Law 171 requires the DOT to engage with communities to inform the redesign of the truck routes. This should include more than a feedback link on a portal. I implore the agency to engage with local community based organizations (such as the Eastern Queens Alliance, Inc., phone# 347-824-2301) and make arrangements to come into our Southeast Queens communities to hear from local residents and to see how they are being impacted by truck traffic.\r\n\r\nFinally, please do not use this re-design to extend truck routes into our already burdened communities and please do not allow 53-foot trucks to travel along our NYC streets. Our communities have enough environmental burdens to contend with as is. \r\n",

Small local delivery trucks have no problem making the turn from Bedford Ave Southbound, but tractor-trailers cannot safely make this turn from Bedford Ave southbound. Several cars parked on the corner of Bedford and Caton have been destroyed by a long truck attempting to make this turn. Tractor trailers have to drive up onto Captain Oakey Square to increase the radius, often taking out the stop sign at the curb. Even if a tractor-trailer uses a trucking GPS (which most don't), including this street as a truck route makes it seem possible to use the street to connect with Rt 27, even though it is not possible and very dangerous.",

There is street parking on the north side of Caton that decreases the turning radius. Trucks often get stuck here, trying to back up onto Flatbush Ave to correct the turn. This causes massive delays for all cars on Caton Ave in both directions and in Flatbush southbound. Pedestrians cannot cross Caton Ave during these episodes. This leads to idling, noise pollution from horns and terribly unsafe conditions as drivers attempt to do unpredictable things to get around the log jam.",

Sometimes they double park, leaving little room to navigate with oncoming traffic. There are safety issues with our little ones coming off school buses safely or out of our personal cars.  ",

Red Hook has become overwhelmed by the truck and traffic congestion created from the construction of so many last-mile warehouses. The trucks drive down Imlay street so fast that I'm terrified to even cross the street with my two young daughters. It's not uncommon for just the sound of the trucks driving so to wake up my kids at night. Please help keep our kids safe by installing some, any, type of traffic control. Thank you",

It's especially upsetting that bikes should have to move onto the sidewalks as well to avoid turning trucks. Also, the noise they make barreling down our street between 5th and 4th Ave rattles the house and seems quite unnecessary given that the wider, and commercial, Flatbush and Atlantic Ave (which runs parallel to Bergen) is only a two blocks away. Not to mention that the narrowness of Bergen St makes it impossible for these trucks to pass local construction vans or other delivery cars, which results in a lot of idling and honking, and quite often yelling and shouting road rage.",

I propose that trucks be kept off Bergen Street between Flatbush and 3rd Avenue since these are residential blocks. These blocks also have a bike path with lots of bicyclists on the street and with trucks speeding down the block, there are multiple chances for a dangerous accident. Another reason trucks should be re-routed off Bergen Street is that there are a LOT of pedestrians - going to stores, restaurants, the Barclays Center, and the subway stations. The several blocks of Bergen Street that are designated a truck route make no sense in terms of ease of transportation (why is the city re-routing trucks off a major street like Flatbush onto residential blocks?) and creates a dangerous situation for bicyclists and pedestrians. Also, trucks speed down the streets trying to make lights and shake the houses. ",

The road is very narrow and there are a lot of cyclists. The street barely fits a bike and a car next to each other. It gets really dangerous when cars double park or trucks sway into the bike lane. Due to their size they often don't see what is going on behind them or next to them. Just today I saw a mother with her children almost squished to death on a bike by a truck driving into the bike lane while bypassing a double parked contractor car. It was pure luck that she found a gap between two parked cars that she could drive in for protection. Please block this road for trucks before someone dies. Trucks don't need to go here. There is plenty of space on Atlantic and Flatbush for trucks. This is a major bike route and residential block a speed bump would help with the speeding and make cyclists safer.               ",

Trucks from 65th want to turn on to 18th and vice versa which leads them right into pedestrians on the crosswalk. As a pedestrian, it feels very unsafe to cross due to the long crossing distance and having the trucks creep on to the crosswalk as you crossing since the trucks do not see you well, which has lead to many close calls on this intersection. More visibility is needed on this intersection for pedestrians and truck drivers alike to reduce the likelihood of crashes and shorter crossing distances for pedestrians would help reduce the danger present at this intersection.",

I've observed instances of collisions or near collisions between pedestrian and trucks at this intersection and the two nearby it, 14th and 15th Ave. Trucks often speed by to make the light. And there is poor pedestrian crossing infrastructure at this intersection as pedestrians here are especially vulnerable to speeding trucks or trucks that turn on to the pedestrian crossing to get to 65th St or New Utrecht. The building supply business contributes to the chaos as they always double-park on both 65th & New Utrecht, creating traffic jams and blocking a pedestrians' view of the road from the crosswalk. They also frequently drive their forklifts on the road while they load, blocking more of the street, and they also drive them on the sidewalk recklessly, with pedestrians having to avoid being hit by them while walking. This intersection along with the other two I mentioned is hostile to pedestrians and needs to be calmed or reconsidered as a truck route in order to prevent future injuries involving trucks from occurring.",

        "comment_body": "Hi - I live on the corner of Furman and Old Fulton Street. This seems to be the most dangerous intersection in NYC. Every single day, without fail, we see a near accident between a pedestrian (generally a clueless tourist who has no idea that a 18-wheeler truck is barreling through the curved/blind intersection. Given the new welcome pavilion being erected at Pier 1 (opening this Fall), and how busy the area is already from the ferry and fulton landing (ferry, fulton ferry landing, etc), I think the city needs to restrict trucks from this intersection. You can't have 18-wheeler trucks whipping around a blind corner where there's 2 ice cream shops and a waterfront park. You're going to have a truck run over a little kid.\r\n\r\nTrucks are clearly taking advantage by using Furman Street instead of the BQE. The result is a loud, dangerous, and hectic scene at what's supposed to be the welcome entrance for the Brooklyn Bridge park. \r\n\r\nMy suggestion - fully eliminate commercial trucks from Furman street. Then stop allowing Ubers from stopping at the middle of the intersection to drop people off - they are creating a ton of traffic and confusion right next to a critical pedestrian walkway.\r\n\r\nI see someone get nearly hit here every single day. Put pedestrians over trucks please! Thank you!!",

Constantly scrapping black dust from the windowsills, the disel trucks that speed down the street at all hours are certaintly to blame.The street has become unliveable due to this pollution and safety hazard to pedestrians and cyclists. Cement trucks have spilled cement numerous times leading to uneven roads. Why is the city building new residential buildings (i.e. corner of Bushwick Ave. and Metropolitan) yet failing to protect the safety of the families who currently live here and will soon live here? Please reroute these trucks to a less residential and commercial street! And please at least add speed bumps. I can't stand to see another biker, dog and pedestrian hit. ",

The city continues to quickly issue permits to build large residential buildings yet slow to consider the hazards to pedestrians due to large truck traffic.   Plus Metropolitan Ave is entirely a single lane road while Meeker is mostly a two lane road from Morgan or Vandervoort to McGuiness.   It's common sense to reroute trucks off of Metropolitan Ave!!",

        "comment_body": "All of West 55th St., but particularly the block between 9th & 10th Aves., has been made very unsafe since the expansion of the curbside bike lane. This block in particular contains a school, factory, commercial, theater- and film-production, and industrial buildings, and warehouses; the need for truck parking is constant.  Yet the painted curbside and bike-lane-side lanes are too narrow for most trucks and even for full-size school buses.  In addition, when a truck or school bus is parked on each side, there is insufficient room for another truck, bus, or even ambulance to get through.  There is a major hospital with emergency room just a few blocks from here, and I often hear ambulances stuck on the street, unable to get through.  Finally, there is a huge dining shed that blocks not only a large part of the parking area, but projects to the edge of the driving lane, and prevents drivers from seeing pedestrians in the 10th Ave. crosswalk coming from the south side of the street.  DOT's layout of this street is extremely dangerous.",

I have loved on this block my whole life and am raising my children here as well. It is a very dangerous street due to the high truck traffic. Trucks should not be allowed on these 2 blocks of residential streets. It's confusing to me that this one stretch of 2 blocks is a truck route, a fire route, has a designated bike lane and is highly trafficked by children and adults walking to and from the busy Atlantic Ave/Pacific St train station and 5th Aves shopping and restaurants. No other residential street in the area also serves as a truck route. I don't think this should be a truck route. Please fix this dangerous and unfair situation. ",

Also, the noise they make barreling down our street between 5th and 4th Ave rattles the house and seems quite unnecessary given that the wider, and commercial, Atlantic Ave runs parallel only a two blocks blocks away.

        "comment_body": "I live on East 7th Street, two houses down from Church avenue. I have two children and there are many children on our block who need to safely cross Church Avenue to get to school, park, or subway. Church avenue has become a dangerous route with trucks, and especially trucks that exceed the 53’ limits. They will be rushing to the entrance to the Prospect Expressway a block away. I’ve observed two of these 53’ tractor trailers get into an accident and the police who came did not issue tickets or enforce the laws against oversize trucks - instead they just rerouted traffic. I want my children to be safe and I’m very concerned about the out of control trucks coming down Church Avenue, especially illegal 53’ tractor trailers, and the complete lack of enforcement. Trucks should be limited here given all the children and already a pattern of accidents. Thank you for trying to make Brooklyn safer and reducing dangerous trucks.",

With the construction of the large residential project on the North side of Bergen between 3rd and 4th, these unsafe and exceptionally crowded and noisy conditions will only get worse. These blocks are also critical components of the city-bound bike infrastructure, with dozens of Citibike docking stations nearby. They are also used by the morning Bergen Street Bike Train for Kids. And furthermore, why do trucks even need to use these blocks? Please don't wait for a study to be completed to make this important change, before another person gets hurt or worse.",

This results in the trucks arriving at Herbert and North Henry, and their only option is to turn left on North Henry toward Meeker. However, many times they can’t make the turn and either go the wrong way (east) down Herbert OR they attempt the left turn and smash into parked cars. I’ve seen this happen at least a dozen times! Hopefully we can remedy this somehow - maybe by making the signage on the BQE off-ramp more noticeable? Thank you for your time!",

A lot of truck/site seeing buses seem to use our street to bypass the turn onto 9th St.  In the evening there are always site seeing buses turning onto this block off of 4th Ave and it is a hard turn for them as the street is one way.  Sometimes the buses will stop near our building, as there is a no parking zone next to our building that is large enough to fit a bus,sometimes for extended periods, before they continue to wherever they are heading.  \r\n\r\nThere is a large UHaul located on this block and not only do the customers speed, but the employees will drive UHaul vehicles the wrong way down the street or the sidewalk at high speed, so they don't have to go around the block in order to move trucks from the back lot which is near 3rd Ave to the front lot that is off of 4th Ave. We also notice that in the early mornings there are deliveries to the commercial businesses that can hold up traffic for extended periods of time as we get to hear all of the honking from the people that get stuck behind these delivery trucks.  This is mainly a commercial street, but the speeding trucks and cars are not safe.  I don't know if anything can be done to stop trucks from turning on 6th Street so they can avoid the 9th Street turn.   I don't think it is possible to add speed bumps on this street because of the commercial businesses, but maybe it would helpful if this street was local delivery and UHaul trucks only to cut down on the speeding vehicles and hold ups from deliveries on this street.

Also because traffic on 3rd is usually bad, drivers are impatient and angry by the time they reach this corner. They do not yield to pedestrians in the crosswalk. Occasionally there are crossing guards posted here but they tend to stand on the less dangerous southern side of this intersection. And the crossing guards are not there consistently enough. This intersection needs to be designed better. 3rd Ave was not designed to have so much truck traffic. It is overloaded. More truck traffic needs to be directed back onto 4th Ave which is wider.  ",

And Caton needs additional daylighting at all existing Parade Grounds t-intersection pedestrian ramps, whether signalized or not.",

Traffic is always backed up as cars (who are bypassing the BQE) wait to turn left on Atlantic to get on the BQE.  There is rarely a backup in the right hand lane.  When a truck is in middle lane, it blocks the view of cars in the right hand lane of anyone using the crosswalk coming from the dog park.  I have been nearly hit by cars going through the stop walk too many times to count.   There was a stop sign here (that was regularly ignored), but at least it was something.  Apaprently, that was meant to temporary for construction at the SW corner of Atlantic and Hicks.  Because there is a stop work order and no construction work has been preformed in years, DOT has claimed the stop sign should not be put back up until construction resumes.  However, even though there is not active construction going on, the scaffolding remains up which blocks the sidewalk on the west side of Hicks.  Whereas one could previously safely cross Hicks at Atlantic and use this sidewalk on the west side, there is now no way to avoid risking your life crossing at the crosswalk at Pacific. ",

DOT must take action to keep these enormous trucks from barreling through our community damaging our roads, creating a terrible amount of noise that negatively effects our health as well as terrible air pollution.  Cyclists and pedestrians are terrified of their speed and dangerous driving as well.  Saint Johns Place is too narrow to be handling east and west traveling traffic, B45, passenger cars, cyclists and enormous illegal truck traffic.  There are constant traffic jams and dangerous games of chicken between drivers trying to get by the stuck B45.  Regular car crashes involving cyclist, pedestrians and motorists.

I had a green light that started counting down to red as I was crossing, so I presume the truck had an orange light. The truck started speeding up to make the turn and probably didn't see me. This was in the evening hours so maybe the visibility was bad. That said, I cross this intersection regularly as I live a block away on Pacific and Clinton and regularly see all types of vehicles going up Clinton trying to quickly make a turn east or west bound on Atlantic before the light changes and given how many people cross this intersection, including kids on scooters, bikes, etc who are low to the ground, it's very scary.

They use this avenue for more than deliveries. I believe when it is for a delivery, the drivers is supposed to make the first turn possible off the avenue after the delivery. This is not happening, and they are speeding as well. This is a residential street with schools as well as many senior citizens. Speeding trucks make the area unsafe, and the trucks are not legally supposed to be on WEST END AVENUE to begin with. I have witnessed several incidents where a speeding (and illegally on the avenue) truck, is running a red light and has nearly hit a pedestrian in the crosswalk. I appreciate the DOT trying to improve or clarify truck routes, but it does not appear there is currently nor has there ever been (in my 40 years of living on West End Ave) any consistent monitoring or ticketing of speeding trucks and trucks that are illegally using WEST END AVNUE. How will this problem be fixed?",

Both Roebling St and Grand St would benefit from having bike lanes and from restricting truck traffic.\r\n3. As noted by another respondent, Roebling St and S4th has a confusing intersection that causes many conflicts of trucks, pedestrians, and bicycles.",

They are loud, large, and have trouble making turns onto the smaller local roads. Not to mention how dangerous it is for pedestrian traffic, which there is much of since Caton Avenue goes through residential neighborhoods with many schools, homes, and the Parade Grounds. I have heard that this part of Caton Ave is a truck route for Rt 27, but I think this should be reconsidered. The neighborhoods it travels through are too populated and the trucks are horrible for quality of life.",

The sheer weight of the tractor trailers and causing the ground to compact. At the edges of the roadways on both directions of Borden ave see elevated levels of asphalt because the weight of the trucks are pushing the asphalt. The sub grade here below the asphalt is either eroding because of the poor drainage here from ground water or a better engineered sub grade needs to be used before applying asphalt. Perhaps using highway grade roadways for this portion of Borden ave is necessary to prevent the need to regrade and repave every 2 years.\r\n",

This street has a short span from Atlantic Avenue to Jamaica Avenue but does not have any businesses l, as it's all zoned residential, to warrant these trucks coming through. Damage to our streets has occurred. Noticed to be all Hispanic drivers. These trucks are very long and block the intersections, as the traffic signals don't align with these cehiclesnwhile crossing the two way streets of Atlantic Ave and Fulton Street. Fulton Street is much narrower than Atlantic Avenue. These large trucks often interfere with the trucks from the shipping company Embarquee AA on Fulton Street and it becomes an unsafe crazy mess for pedestrians, students (school a block away on Ridgrwood and Nichols), seniors and other people. Why are trucks of this size allowed on the residential streets of Nichols Avenue.",

This is a one lane road (each way) and only 1-2 trucks can exit at a time waiting for the next light to get back onto the highway.

Due to the excessive traffic issues of trucks trying to get onto the EAST bound LIE from the Southbound Clearview, trucks get off at 73rd avenue and then back on the NORTHBOUND clearview to get onto the LIE.  Bypassing traffic but creating a horrible traffic jam trying to get off the exit to 73rd avenue - which is where I live.  Because the trucks are so large and they must wait until the light to get back onto the clearview, only one to two trucks can exit at a time, creating a long wait to get off the highway.  Sign needs to be more prominent and closer to the exit and on BOTH sides of the exit.  There should be better enforcement to prevent trucks from using this as a bypass route.  ",

Trucks travelling along 69th ST. pass many residential homes. These homes are subjected to excessive noise emanating from the truck as the pass, from their motors and air brakes. The noise is unbearable and causes hardship and is unhealthy because residents cannot use their yards because of the traffic noise due to the narrow width of 69th Street. A noise level study should be considered or the route modified to avoid areas with residential homes. ",
